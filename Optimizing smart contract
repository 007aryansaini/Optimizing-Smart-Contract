-->    Transaction fees = ( gas consumed * gas price ) * ( ether / 10^9 )

                       Only we can reduce the gas consumtipn then only our transaction fees is reduced.
                       
                      #Note : The size of the block of the bitcoin blockchain is 1 MB, Whereas the size of one block of ethereum blockchain is 
                              " 30 million gas ".
                              
                      #Note : The maximum no. of transaction in an ethereum block can be = 30 million / 21000 = 1428 transactions.
                              Since a minimum typical transaction is of 21000 gas.
